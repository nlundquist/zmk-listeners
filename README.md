# zmk-listeners

ZMK module to invoke behaviors on certain events.

## Usage

Add the following entries to `remotes` and `projects` in `config/west.yml`.

```yaml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: ssbb
      url-base: https://github.com/ssbb
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: zmk-listeners
      remote: ssbb
      revision: v1
  self:
    path: config
```

## Layer Listeners

Layer listeners are specified like this:

```c
/ {
    layer_listeners {
        compatible = "zmk,layer-listeners";

        // Call &haptic_feedback_in on layer enter, and &haptic_feedback_out on layer leave
        nav_num_feedback {
            layers = <NAV NUM>;
            bindings = <&haptic_feedback_in &haptic_feedback_out>;
        };

        // Call &reset_nav on NAV layer leave
        nav_reset {
            layers = <NAV>;
            bindings = <&none &reset_nav>;
        };
    };
}
```

### Root properties

- `tap-ms`: The time to wait (in milliseconds) between the press and release events of a triggered behavior. Defaults to 5 ms.
- `wait-ms`: The time to wait (in milliseconds) before triggering the next listener. Defaults to 5 ms.

### Listener Properties

Each listener is defined as a child node.

- `layers` (required): A list of layers to which this listener should apply.
- `bindings` (required): The first behavior is triggered on layer entry, and the second on layer exit. Use `&none` for the other if you need only one. Second binding (layer leave) can be omitted if not needed.

## Keycode Listeners

```c
/ {
    keycode_listeners {
        compatible = "zmk,keycode-listeners";

        // Call &haptic_feedback_key_press on key press, and &haptic_feedback_key_release on key release
        a_b_feedback {
            layers = <NAV NUM>;
            keycodes = <A B>;
            bindings = <&haptic_feedback_key_press &haptic_feedback_key_release>;
        };
    };
}
```

### Root properties

- `tap-ms`: The time to wait (in milliseconds) between the press and release events of a triggered behavior. Defaults to 5 ms.
- `wait-ms`: The time to wait (in milliseconds) before triggering the next listener. Defaults to 5 ms.

### Listener Properties

Each listener is defined as a child node.

- `keycodes` (required): A list of keycodes to which this listener should apply. Implicit modifiers (eg `LG(C)`) are supported.
- `layers` (optional): A list of layers to which this listener should apply.
- `bindings` (required): The first behavior is triggered on key press, and the second on key release. Use `&none` for the other if you need only one. Second binding (key release) can be omitted if not needed.

## USB HID LED Listeners

```c
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/hid_usage.h>

/ {
    hid_listeners {
        compatible = "zmk,hid-listeners";

        // Call &haptic_feedback_led_on when caps lock led enables, and &haptic_feedback_led_off when caps lock disables
        caps_feedback {           
            indicator = <HID_USAGE_LED_CAPS_LOCK>;
            bindings = <&haptic_feedback_led_on &haptic_feedback_led_off>;
        };
    };
}
```

### Root properties

- `tap-ms`: The time to wait (in milliseconds) between the press and release events of a triggered behavior. Defaults to 5 ms.
- `wait-ms`: The time to wait (in milliseconds) before triggering the next listener. Defaults to 5 ms.

### Listener Properties

Each listener is defined as a child node.

- `indicator` (required): A constant from `dt-binding/zmk/hid_usage.h` representing either the NUM LOCK, CAPS LOCK, SCROLL LOCK, KANA, or COMPOSE LED state. These are the only USB HID LED states emitted by the underlying ZMK event.
- `bindings` (required): The first behavior is triggered on key press, and the second on key release. Use `&none` for the other if you need only one. Second binding (key release) can be omitted if not needed.
